\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}


Harmonic/percussive source separation (HPSS) is based on the observation that harmonic instruments are tonal sounds very localized in frequency that can be modeled by a sum of sinusoidal waves and percussive instruments are wide band transient signals.

Harmonic instruments can be classified into several categories such as for example struck string instruments (piano, harpsichord, \ldots), plucked string instruments (guitar, mandolin, \ldots) or brass instruments (trumpet, tuba, \ldots)~\cite{peeters2003automatic}. These instruments can be modeled as a sum of three components: the Sinusoidal part, the Transients and the Residual, so called  Sines + Transients + Noise (STN) models~\cite{daudet2006review}. The transient of the harmonic instruments show some percussive properties (i.e., fast attack and fast decay). Taking into account the transient part of harmonic instruments is a challenging task that will not be treated this article. Here, as in other article of the literature, we rely on the hypothesis that most of the energy of the harmonic signal is in the tonal part. 


HPSS has numerous applications as a preprocessing step. For example most multi-pitch estimation models~\cite{klapuri2008multipitch}, instruments recognition~\cite{eronen2000musical} and melody extraction~\cite{salamon2012melody} ISMIR RIGAUD algorithms are much more efficient on harmonic instruments alone. Indeed, these algorithms often rely on the analysis of the harmonic structures that are blurred by the percussive instruments. Similarly, drum transcription algorithms~\cite{paulus2005drum} CITE ISMIR are more accurate if the harmonic instruments are not part of the signal. Finally, using the Median Filtering (MF) algorithm~\cite{fitzgerald2010harmonic} as a preprocessing step increases the performance for singing pitch extraction and voice separation~\cite{hsu2012tandem}. 


A well known unsupervised method to extract the harmonic/percussive components consists in applying a Median Filtering (MF) on the spectrogram of the audio signal~\cite{fitzgerald2010harmonic}. The filtering is made across the temporal atoms to diminish the transient sounds in order to extract the harmonic components. Mutually, the filtering is made across frequency to reduce the harmonic tonal sounds and to enhance the percussive instruments. The assumption made is that the harmonics are considered to be outliers in a temporal frame that contains a mixture of percussive and pitched instruments. Similarly, the percussive onsets are considered to be outliers in a frequency frame. This method is often used in the \emph{Music Information Retrieval} community as it does not require any parameter tuning and is computationally effective. The main problem of this method is that it does perform well on non stationary signal and the voice for example is spliced between the harmonic and percussive part. 
% However, on a small scale test conducted by~\cite{canadas2014percussive}, this simple approach does not give the best separation results.

Another unsupervised method uses a NMF decomposition with specific constraints to distinguish the harmonic part from the percussive components~\cite{canadas2014percussive}. A simple approximation is that percussive instruments are transient sounds with regular spectra (wide band signals) whereas harmonic instruments are tonal sounds with harmonic sparse spectra. This method gives good results compared to other state-of-the-art methods but this article will show that the results depend heavily on the training database.

A supervised method uses a Non-Negative Matrix Partial Co-Factorization (NMPCF)~\cite{kim2011nonnegative} to extract the drums. The spectrogram of the signal and the drum-only data (obtained from prior learning) are simultaneously decomposed in order to determine common basis vectors that capture the spectral and temporal characteristics of drum sources. The shared dictionary matrix retrieves the drum signal. However it must be chosen carefully in order to obtain satisfying results. The percussive part of the decomposition is constrained while the harmonic part is completely unconstrained. As a result, it tends to decompose a lot of information (i.e., the harmonic part contains some percussive instruments) from the signal and the decomposition is not satisfactory.
% In the NMPCF, the dictionary is not fixed. We will compare this method to the SPNMF were the dictionary is fixed. 

%This has motivated the development of methods for HPSS in the music signal processing area. We will focus on three methods that are particularly relevant to our benchmark. 

%Finally some methods use a so-called semi-supervised algorithm where data from scores helps the constrained decomposition method~\cite{hennequin2011score,fritsch2013score} %{\MK Je pense que ce paragraphe peut √™tre supprim√©: il n'en dit pas assez, et je ne suis pas s√ªr qu'il soit n√©cessaire de d√©velopper. Ou alors, il faut l'int√©grer au paragraphe suivant qui parle de technique semi-supervis√©e. Mais la, il me parait un peu esseul\'e.} {\HP OK pour l'intégrer à la suite. Definir méthode semi-supervisee, citer comme exemple celles [15,16] et dire pourquoi celle proposée rentre dans cette categorie.}


In this article, we propose a weakly-supervised decomposition technique suitable for harmonic/percussive source separation of non vocal monophonic instrumental signals. The sparse and orthogonal components of the Projective NMF (PNMF) are prone to extract the harmonic instruments well localized in frequency, while the percussive part with flat spectra are extracted by the NMF components. However, as shown in~\cite{laroche2015structured} this approach obtains limited performances in a blind source separation task when the percussive part is unconstrained. To force the non-orthogonal components to extract the drum signal, we use a dictionary specific to drum signals using the same technique as in~\cite{wudrum}.

The contributions of this article are threefold
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Structured Projected Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (SPNMF) method is introduced, as well as a simple multiplicative algorithm to solve the SPNMF problem.
\item  We offer a comparison between two different training methods to establish the best drum dictionary.
\item We perform a benchmark against three state of the art harmonic/percussive methods on a large database.	
\end{enumerate}

The paper is organized as follows. In Section~\ref{sec:Background}, we describe the problem of harmonic/percussive source separation and we explain in details some recent state-of-the-art methods. The proposed SPNMF is then introduced in Section~\ref{sec:SPNMF}. We present our experimental protocol and the results obtained on synthetic and real audio signals in Section~\ref{sec:experiments}. Section~\ref{sec:stateoftheart} is a benchmark with state of the art methods. Finally, some conclusions are drawn in Section~\ref{sec:conc}.
