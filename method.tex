\section{Structured projective NMF (SPNMF)}
\label{sec:SPNMF}

In this section we present our semi-supervised algorithm for harmonic/percussive source separation.

\subsection{Principle of the SPNMF}

The orthogonal basis functions of the PNMF are not flexible enough to decompose a complex audio signal. As stated in~\cite{canadas2014percussive}, harmonic instruments have sparse basis functions whereas percussive instruments have much flatter spectra. As the columns of $W$ are orthogonal, when two sources overlap in the Time-Frequency (TF) plane only one basis function will represent the mixture which is not adequate for efficient separation. To overcome this problem, we propose to add a standard NMF decomposition term to the PNMF. We can expect that most of the harmonic components will be represented by the orthogonal part while the percussive ones will be the regular NMF components. Using a similar model to preliminary work~\cite{laroche2015structured}, let $V$ be the magnitude spectrogram of the input data. The model is then given by
\begin{equation} \label{Cfunction}
V \approx \tilde{V}= V_H + V_{P},
\end{equation}
with $V_P$ the spectrogram of the percussive part and $V_H$ the spectrogram of the harmonic part. $V_H$ is approximated by the PNMF decomposition while $W_P$ is decomposed by some NMF components as :
\begin{equation}
V \approx \tilde{V}= W_{H}W_{H}^{T}V + W_{P} H_{P}.
\end{equation}
The data matrix is approximated by an almost orthogonal sparse part that codes the harmonic instruments $V_H = W_HW_H^T V$ and a non constrained NMF part that codes the percussive instruments $V_P = W_PH_P$. The main advantage of the SPNMF results is in the fact that the method has few parameters compared to constrained NMF~\cite{canadas2014percussive} and NMPCF~\cite{kim2011nonnegative} while still obtaining similar results~\cite{laroche2015structured}. 


\subsection{Using regularized NMF for the harmonic part}

In order to highlight the advantages of using the PNMF for the harmonic part, we also designed a regularized method. Let $V$ be the magnitude spectrogram of the input data, the model is given by 
\begin{equation}
V \approx \tilde{V} = W_HH_H + W_P  H_P.
\end{equation}
The optimization problem is then:
\begin{equation}\label{REGNMF}
\min_{W_{H},W_{P},H_{P}}D(V|\tilde{V}) + k_{TSM} TSM + k_{SSP} SSP.
\end{equation} 

The constraints TSM and SSP are from equation \eqref{TSM} and \eqref{TSM} respectively. The hyperparameters $k_{TSM}$ and $k_{SSP}$ control the amount of temporal smoothness and spectral sparseness. This model replace the PNMF components by a regularized NMF (RegNMF) to extract the harmonic part. This requires prior tuning of the variables $k_{SSP}$ and $k_{SSP}$. 


\subsection{Optimization Algorithm}

In order to achieve such a decomposition, we can use a measure of fit $D(x|y)$ between the data matrix $V$ and the estimated matrix $\tilde{V}$. $D(x|y)$ is a scalar cost function and in this article we compare in Section \ref{setup:divergence} the use of the Euclidean distance (Euc), the Kullback Leiber (KL) divergence and the Itakura Saito (IS) divergence which are three commonly used divergences in the NMF framework.



The SPNMF model gives the following cost function : 
\begin{equation}\label{InitCost}
\min_{W_H,W_P,H_P \geq 0} D(V|W_{H}W_{H}^{T}V + W_{P} H_{P})  
\end{equation}

A solution of this problem can be obtained by iterative multiplicative update rules following the same strategy as in~\cite{yuanOja2005,Lee01algorithmsfor} which consists in splitting the gradient with respect to (wrt) one variable (here $W_H$ for exemple) $\nabla_{W_H} D(V|\tilde{V})$ in its positive $[\nabla_{W_H} D(V|\tilde{V})]^{+}$ and negative parts $[\nabla_{W_H} D(V|\tilde{V})]^{-}$.
The multiplicative updates for SPNMF are then given by: 
$$W_{H} \leftarrow W_{H} \otimes \frac{ [\nabla_{W_H} D(V|\tilde{V})]^{-} }{[\nabla_{W_H} D(V|\tilde{V})]^{+}}, $$
where $\otimes$ is the Hadamard product or element-wise product. Details of the equations for the Euc distance, KL and IS divergences are given in the annex in Sections \ref{euclidisteq}, \ref{KLdisteq} and \ref{ISdisteq} respectively. 
The optimization of the SPNMF algorithm is done sequentially, as described in Algorithm \ref{AlgoMultipl}.

\subsection{SPNMF with a fixed dictionary}\label{fixedict}  

A fully unsupervised SPNMF model does not allow for a satisfying harmonic/percussive source separation~\cite{laroche2015structured}. To alleviate this problem, we use here a fixed drum dictionary $W_p$ for the percussive part of the SPNMF which is created using the drum database ENST-Drums~\cite{gillet2006enst}. In this database three professional drum players specialized in a specific type of music have been recorded. Each drummer used a specific drum set from a small one (two toms and two cymbals) to a full rock drum kit (four toms and five cymbals). 

%Two different ways can be used to build a dictionary. 
The main method to construct a dictionary is to perform a NMF decomposition on a large database~\cite{jaureguiberry2011adaptation}. The rank of factorization is an important learning variable that will be discussed in a later section. This method is effective at giving a dictionary specific to an instrument and the size of the dictionary is maintained low so it does not increase the computation time. However, the template of the dictionary does not represent a single element of the drum kit so it is not possible to perform direct drum transcription.

%A second way to build the dictionary is to directly use the STFT of a drum signal~\cite{wudrum}. The ENST-Drum database contains audio files where elements of the drum kit are played independently and that we used to build other types of drum dictionary. This method allows having a specific dictionary, yet the matrix is redundant and very large which increases the computation time. Both learning methods are compared in Section \ref{setup:dictionary}.

The main advantage of the proposed method over the previously mentioned concurrent approaches is that it can take into account some of the percussive instruments that have a sparse spectrum. The bass drum and the toms have almost harmonic spectra with most energy in the low frequency range. These sounds are consequently hard to extract while enforcing frequency regularity of the percussive part like in~\cite{canadas2014percussive,ono2008separation}.

The SPNMF algorithm with the fixed dictionary matrix is described by Algorithm \ref{AlgoDictionary}.

\subsection{Signal reconstruction}

The percussive signal $x_p(t)$ is synthesized using the magnitude percussive spectrogram $V_P = W_PH_P$. To reconstruct the phase of the percussive part, we use a generalized Wiener filter~\cite{liutkus:hal-01110028} to create a percussive mask as:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{M}_P = \frac{V_P^2}{V_M^2 + V_P^2},
\end{equation} 
\noindent, To retrieve the percussive signal as 
\begin{equation}
x_p(t) = InverseSTFT(\mathcal{M}_P \otimes X),
\end{equation}
\noindent where $X$ is the complex spectrogram of the mixture.

Similarly for the harmonic part, we obtain:
\begin{equation}\label{percuwiener}
\mathcal{M}_H = \frac{V_H^2}{V_M^2 + V_P^2},
\end{equation}
and:
\begin{equation}
x_h(t) = InverseSTFT(\mathcal{M}_H \otimes X).
\end{equation}
